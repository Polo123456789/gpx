Golang Package eXecute
======================

Todo
----

* [x] Parse tools.go and go.mod
* [ ] Install binaries on a global directory, and run them from there (The
  directory is either `os.UserCacheDir()/gpx` or `$GPX_BIN` if set)
* [ ] Auto install on run
* [ ] Add more commands (Like install all tools, cleanup cache, idk what else)
* [ ] Can we add something more? Working globally?
